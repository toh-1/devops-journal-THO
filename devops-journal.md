## üìÖ DevOps Fundamentals (June 16, 2025)

### ‚úÖ What I Learned Today
- DevOps promotes collaboration between developers and operations.
- DevOps lifecycle includes: Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, and Monitor.
- Learned shell commands like `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, and created files/folders using `mkdir`, `touch`.
- Started using Git for version control and began basic scripting.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Commands Practiced
```bash
pwd                        # Show current directory
ls                         # List files and folders
cd ~                       # Go to home directory
mkdir practice-project     # Create project folder
cd practice-project        # Enter project folder
mkdir scripts logs configs # Create subfolders
touch README.md            # Create markdown file
touch scripts/start.sh     # Create shell script file
touch logs/debug.log       # Create log file
touch configs/settings.yaml # Create config file
```

### üß† Quiz Reflections
**Q:** What is DevOps?  
**A:** DevOps is a collaborative approach combining software development and IT operations for faster, high-quality delivery.

**Q:** What does `pwd` do?  
**A:** It prints the current working directory.

**Q:** Name 2 tools used in DevOps.  
**A:** Git and Docker.

### üîç Challenges / Confusions
- Mistakenly tried to run a `.md` file in terminal and got an error.
- Accidentally staged too many files using `git add .` instead of specifying the exact file.
- Didn‚Äôt understand the shell script execution process at first (`./start.sh`).

### üí° Lessons Learned
- Only stage specific files using `git add <file>` unless you're sure.
- Use `ls -a` to view hidden files.
- Shell scripts require the `#!/bin/bash` shebang to run properly.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Notes to My Future Self
- Always double-check what files are staged before committing.
- Explore each command interactively to build stronger muscle memory.
- Mistakes are expected ‚Äî each one is a lesson.

## üìÖ Scripting & File Execution Practice (June 17‚Äì19, 2025)

### ‚úÖ What I Learned Today
- Created and executed a shell script to simulate a DevOps log system.
- Understood how to redirect outputs to a log file.
- Practiced editing and pushing journal entries to GitHub.
- Deepened understanding of the Git workflow (`status`, `add`, `commit`, `push`).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Commands Practiced
```bash
./start.sh                       # Run shell script
echo "Text" >> file.log          # Append log
cat logs/debug.log               # View log file content
cd ..                            # Move up a directory
git add devops-journal.md        # Stage single file
git commit -m "Message"          # Commit changes
git push                         # Push to remote repository
```

### üß† Quiz Reflections
**Q:** How do you view a file page by page?  
**A:** Use `less filename` for paginated view.

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between `cat` and `less`?  
**A:** `cat` shows entire content immediately; `less` allows scrolling.

**Q:** What does `ls -a` show?  
**A:** It shows all files, including hidden ones.

### üîç Challenges / Confusions
- Confused shell script with a directory at first.
- Appended to a log file repeatedly without realizing.
- Initially forgot to add commit messages during `git commit`.

### üí° Lessons Learned
- Use `git status` before every commit to avoid mistakes.
- A good commit message documents your changes clearly.
- Understand the command's effect before running it.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Notes to My Future Self
- Reinforce learning by reviewing what was confusing each day.
- Don‚Äôt rush ‚Äî slow and correct builds strong confidence.
- Practice writing and debugging small scripts regularly.
