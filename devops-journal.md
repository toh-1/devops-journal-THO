## 📅 Day 1 – DevOps Fundamentals (June 16, 2025)

### ✅ What I Learned Today
DevOps is the combination of development and operations. It is a methodology that promotes collaboration between the development and operations teams to build, test, and deploy software more efficiently.

I also learned about the DevOps lifecycle, which includes: Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, and Monitor.

The `pwd` command means "print working directory" and is used to see where you are in your terminal.


Some tools used in DevOps include Git, Docker, and Kubernetes.

### ⌨️ Commands Practiced

pwd         # Show current directory
ls          # List files/folders
cd ~        # Go to home directory

### 🔍 Challenges / Confusions
- I tried opening the Markdown file from the terminal but got an error. I now understand that .md files aren’t commands — they must be opened using code or from the VS Code interface.

### ✍️ Notes to My Future Self
- 
Don’t forget to save .md files before running git add, or Git won’t detect changes.

Practice basic terminal commands every day to stay sharp.

Be patient with setup — even mistakes are part of becoming skilled!
