## 📅 Day 1 – DevOps Fundamentals (June 16, 2025)

### ✅ What I Learned Today
DevOps is the combination of development and operations. It is a methodology that promotes collaboration between the development and operations teams to build, test, and deploy software more efficiently.

I also learned about the DevOps lifecycle, which includes: Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, and Monitor.

The `pwd` command means "print working directory" and is used to see where you are in your terminal.


Some tools used in DevOps include Git, Docker, and Kubernetes.

### ⌨️ Commands Practiced

pwd         # Show current directory
ls          # List files/folders
cd ~        # Go to home directory


### 🧠 Quiz Reflections

Q1: What does DevOps stand for?
A1: DevOps stands for Development and Operations. It’s a practice that encourages collaboration between developers and operations to improve the speed and quality of software delivery.

Q2: What does pwd do?
A2: It prints the working directory, showing the current location in the file system.

Q3: Name 2 tools used in DevOps.
A3: Git and Docker.

### 🔍 Challenges / Confusions
- I tried opening the Markdown file from the terminal but got an error. I now understand that .md files aren’t commands — they must be opened using code or from the VS Code interface.

### ✍️ Notes to My Future Self
- 
Don’t forget to save .md files before running git add, or Git won’t detect changes.

Practice basic terminal commands every day to stay sharp.

Be patient with setup — even mistakes are part of becoming skilled!

## 📅 Day 2: File and Directory Management Practice (June 17, 2025)

### ⌨️ Commands Practiced
```bash
mkdir practice-project
cd practice-project
mkdir scripts logs configs
touch README.md
touch scripts/start.sh
touch logs/debug.log
touch configs/settings.yaml

🧠 Quiz Reflections
Q: Why do we use mkdir?

A: To create a directory (folder) in Linux.

Q: What does touch do?

A: It creates a blank file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.


🔍 Challenges / Confusions
I had trouble seeing the folders in VS Code until I navigated and opened the correct folder.

I also had an issue with opening VS Code using code . but fixed it.

- I originally meant to only commit `devops-journal.md` but ended up pushing the full `practice-project` folder too.

I learned how `git add .` adds everything, and next time I’ll use `git add filename` if I want more control. It still worked, and now I understand the Git workflow better!

Notes to My Future Self
Always double-check you're in the correct directory using pwd.

Don’t panic if files don’t show up — use VS Code’s File → Open Folder to fix it.

Use ls to list files and confirm your structure.

Be patient — everything is learnable!

## 📅 Day 3 – Linux Navigation & File Viewing (June 18, 2025)

### ✅ What I Learned Today
Today I learned how to move around the Linux file system using commands like `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, and `ls -a`. I now understand how to check where I am in the system, how to go up one level (`cd ..`), and how to explore contents in a folder.

I also learned how to view and inspect files using:
- `cat` to display entire files
- `less` to scroll through long files
- `head` and `tail` to preview top/bottom lines
- `>>` to append new content to logs (like `debug.log`)

This gave me real confidence for working inside a Linux server environment.

### ⌨️ Commands Practiced

```bash
pwd
ls
ls -l
ls -a
cd scripts
cd ..
cd logs
cd ../configs
cd ~
cd -
cat README.md
less README.md
head README.md
tail README.md
echo "Error: service failed to start" >> logs/debug.log
cat logs/debug.log


🧠 Quiz Reflections
Q1: What command shows your current working directory?
A1: pwd

Q2: How do you go one level up in the directory tree?
A2: cd ..

Q3: What does ls -a show that ls does not?
A3: Hidden files (like .git and .bashrc)

Q4:

a: Use head to see the first few lines of a file

b: Use less to view a file page-by-page

c: Use >> filename to append to a file

Q5: What’s the difference between cat and less?
A5: cat shows everything at once, while less lets you scroll page-by-page.

🔍 Challenges / Confusions
At first, I didn’t see some of the folders in my file explorer, but I now understand how to check file visibility and navigate better.

I also learned how Git tracks modified files and how to focus my commits properly.

✍️ Notes to My Future Self
Always use pwd and ls to confirm where you are before making changes.

Use >> carefully — it appends without confirmation.

Don’t rush through terminal navigation — it’s the foundation of DevOps!

### ✅ Once You’ve Updated the File:

1. Save the file in VS Code.  
2. Run:
```bash
git add devops-journal.md
git commit -m "Day 3 journal entry"
git push


 DevOps Journal – Day 4 (June 19, 2025)
✅ What I Learned Today

I learned how to write and run a shell script using bash.

I understood how the script file is not a folder, and that you can’t cd into it — it must be run with ./filename.sh.

I used the echo command to print messages in the terminal.

I learned how to use >> to append to a log file and how file paths like ../logs/debug.log work.

⌨️ Commands Practiced

cd scripts/
./start.sh
cat ../logs/debug.log
echo "Started at: $(date)" >> ../logs/debug.log
code start.sh

 Quiz Reflection
Q: What’s the purpose of >> in Bash scripting?
A: It appends output to an existing file without overwriting it.

Q: Why can’t we cd start.sh?
A: Because it’s a file, not a directory. We use ./start.sh to run it.

🔍 Challenges

I got confused trying to cd into start.sh, but I now understand the difference between files and folders.

I also learned how to properly edit and save .sh files in VS Code.

Notes to My Future Self

Always use >> if you want to keep previous log entries.

Use code filename to open a file in VS Code quickly.

Make sure to run shell scripts from the correct directory with ./filename.sh.
